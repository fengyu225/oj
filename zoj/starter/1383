Given a positive integer n, print out the positions of all 1's in its binary
representation. The position of the least significant bit is 0.

  
**Example**  
  
The positions of 1's in the binary representation of 13 are 0, 2, 3.

  
**Task**  
  
Write a program which for each data set:

reads a positive integer n,

  
computes the positions of 1's in the binary representation of n,

  
writes the result.

  
**Input**  
  
The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to
the number of data sets, 1 <= d <= 10. The data sets follow.

  
Each data set consists of exactly one line containing exactly one integer n, 1
<= n <= 10^6.

  
**Output**  
  
The output should consists of exactly d lines, one line for each data set.

  
Line i, 1 <= i <= d, should contain increasing sequence of integers separated
by single spaces - the positions of 1's in the binary representation of the
i-th input number.

  
**Sample Input**

1

13

  
**Sample Output**

0 2 3
