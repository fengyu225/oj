An inch worm is at the bottom of a well n inches deep. It has enough energy to
climb u inches every minute, but then has to rest a minute before climbing
again. During the rest, it slips down d inches. The process of climbing and
resting then repeats. How long before the worm climbs out of the well? We'll
always count a portion of a minute as a whole minute and if the worm just
reaches the top of the well at the end of its climbing, we'll assume the worm
makes it out.

  
**Input**  
  
There will be multiple problem instances. Each line will contain 3 positive
integers n, u and d. These give the values mentioned in the paragraph above.
Furthermore, you may assume d < u and n < 100. A value of n = 0 indicates end
of output.

  
**Output**  
  
Each input instance should generate a single integer on a line, indicating the
number of minutes it takes for the worm to climb out of the well.

  
**Sample Input**  
  
10 2 1

20 3 1

0 0 0

  
**Sample Output**
