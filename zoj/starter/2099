You are going to read a sequence of pairs of integer numbers. Each pair
represents the Cartesian coordinates of a point in a 2-dimentional plane. The
first number is the x coordinate, while the second is that of y. The sequence
represents a polygonal line. Your task is to draw a rectangle with minimal
length of sides that exactly surrounds the polygonal line. The sides of the
rectangle are parallel to x- and y-axis, respectively.

  
**Input**  
  
Input consists of several test cases. For each case, a sequence of coordinates
is given. Each pair of x and y occupies a line, with |x| and |y| less than
2^31. The sequence is terminated with a pair of 0's. Note that (0, 0) will
never be considered as a point on any of the polygonal lines. An empty
polygonal line signals the end of input.

  
**Output**  
  
For each test case, print in one line two pairs of numbers, which are the
south-west and north-east corners of the surrounding rectangle. The numbers
must be separated by one space as is indicated in the samples.
