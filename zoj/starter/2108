The highest building in our city has only one elevator. A request list is made
up with N positive numbers. The numbers denote at which floors the elevator
will stop, in specified order. It costs 6 seconds to move the elevator up one
floor, and 4 seconds to move down one floor. The elevator will stay for 5
seconds at each stop.

  
For a given request list, you are to compute the total time spent to fulfill
the requests on the list. The elevator is on the 0th floor at the beginning
and does not have to return to the ground floor when the requests are
fulfilled.

  
**Input**  
  
There are multiple test cases. Each case contains a positive integer N,
followed by N positive numbers. All the numbers in the input are less than
100. A test case with N = 0 denotes the end of input. This test case is not to
be processed.

  
**Output**  
  
Print the total time on a single line for each test case.
