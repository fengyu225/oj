Superbowl Sunday is nearly here. In order to pass the time waiting for the
half-time commercials and wardrobe malfunctions, the local hackers have
organized a betting pool on the game. Members place their bets on the sum of
the two final scores, or on the absolute difference between the two scores.

Given the winning numbers for each type of bet, can you deduce the final
scores?

  

**Input**

The first line of input contains n, the number of test cases. n lines follow,
each representing a test case. Each test case gives s and d, non-negative
integers representing the sum and (absolute) difference between the two final
scores.

  

**Output**

For each test case, output a line giving the two final scores, largest first.
If there are no such scores, output a line containing "impossible". Recall
that football scores are always non-negative integers.

  

**Sample Input**

2

40 20

20 40

  

**Sample Output**

30 10

impossible
