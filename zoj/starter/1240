You may have heard of the book '2001 - A Space Odyssey' by Arthur C. Clarke,
or the film of the same name by Stanley Kubrick. In it a spaceship is sent
from Earth to Saturn. The crew is put into stasis for the long flight, only
two men are awake, and the ship is controlled by the intelligent computer HAL.
But during the flight HAL is acting more and more strangely, and even starts
to kill the crew on board. We don't tell you how the story ends, in case you
want to read the book for yourself :-)

After the movie was released and became very popular, there was some
discussion as to what the name 'HAL' actually meant. Some thought that it
might be an abbreviation for 'Heuristic ALgorithm'. But the most popular
explanation is the following: if you replace every letter in the word HAL by
its successor in the alphabet, you get ... IBM.

Perhaps there are even more acronyms related in this strange way! You are to
write a program that may help to find this out.

  
**Input**

The input starts with the integer n on a line by itself - this is the number
of strings to follow. The following n lines each contain one string of at most
50 upper-case letters.

  
**Output**

For each string in the input, first output the number of the string, as shown
in the sample output. The print the string start is derived from the input
string by replacing every time by the following letter in the alphabet, and
replacing 'Z' by 'A'.

Print a blank line after each test case.

  
**Sample Input**
