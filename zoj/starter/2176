Bill and Ted are taking a road trip. But the odometer in their car is broken,
so they don't know how many miles they have driven. Fortunately, Bill has a
working stopwatch, so they can record their speed and the total time they have
driven. Unfortunately, their record keeping strategy is a little odd, so they
need help computing the total distance driven. You are to write a program to
do this computation.

For example, if their log shows

> Speed in miles per hour

> Total elapsed time in hours

>

> 20

> 2

>

> 30

> 6

>

> 10

> 7

this means they drove 2 hours at 20 miles per hour, then 6-2=4 hours at 30
miles per hour, then 7-6=1 hour at 10 miles per hour. The distance driven is
then (2)(20) + (4)(30) + (1)(10) = 40 + 120 + 10 = 170 miles. Note that the
total elapsed time is always since the beginning of the trip, not since the
previous entry in their log.

**Input**

The input consists of one or more data sets. Each set starts with a line
containing an integer _n_, 1  n  10,&nbsp_place_holder; followed by _n_
pairs of values, one pair per line. The first value in a pair, s, is the speed
in miles per hour and the second value, t, is the total elapsed time. Both s
and t are integers, 1  s  90 and 1  t  12.&nbsp_place_holder; The values
for t are always in strictly increasing order. A value of -1 for n signals the
end of the input.

**Output**

For each input set, print the distance driven, followed by a space, followed
by the word "miles".&nbsp_place_holder;
