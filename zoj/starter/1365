Mileage program of ACM (Airline of Charming Merlion) is really nice for the
travelers flying frequently. Once you complete a flight with ACM, you can earn
ACMPerk miles in your ACM Mileage Bank depended on mileage you actual fly. In
addition, you can use the ACMPerk mileage in your Mileage Bank to exchange
free flight ticket of ACM in future.

The following table helps you calculate how many ACMPerk miles you can earn
when you fly on ACM.

When you fly ACM

Class Code

You'll earn

First Class

F

Actual mileage + 100% mileage Bonus

Business Class

B

Actual mileage + 50% mileage Bonus

Economy Class

1-500 miles

500+ miles

Y

  
500 miles

Actual mileage

It's shown that your ACMPerk mileage consists of two parts. One is your actual
flight mileage (the minimum ACMPerk mileage for Economy Class for one flight
is 500 miles), the other is the mileage bonus (its accuracy is up to 1 mile)
when you fly in Business Class and First Class. For example, you can earn 1329
ACMPerk miles, 1994 ACMPerk miles and 2658 ACMPerk miles for Y, B or F class
respectively for the fly from Beijing to Tokyo (the actual mileage between
Beijing and Tokyo is 1329 miles). When you fly from Shanghai to Wuhan, you can
earn ACMPerk 500 miles for economy class and ACMPerk 650 miles for business
class (the actual mileage between Shanghai and Wuhan is 433 miles).

Your task is to help ACM build a program for automatic calculation of ACMPerk
mileage.
