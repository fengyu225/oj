Little Bob likes playing with his box of bricks. He puts the bricks one upon
another and builds stacks of different height. ``Look, I've built a wall!'',
he tells his older sister Alice. ``Nah, you should make all stacks the same
height. Then you would have a real wall.'', she retorts. After a little con-
sideration, Bob sees that she is right. So he sets out to rearrange the
bricks, one by one, such that all stacks are the same height afterwards. But
since Bob is lazy he wants to do this with the minimum number of bricks moved.
Can you help?

**Input **  
  
The input consists of several data sets. Each set begins with a line
containing the number n of stacks Bob has built. The next line contains n
numbers, the heights hi of the n stacks. You may assume 1 <= n <= 50 and 1 <=
hi <= 100.

  
The total number of bricks will be divisible by the number of stacks. Thus, it
is always possible to rearrange the bricks such that all stacks have the same
height.

The input is terminated by a set starting with n = 0. This set should not be
processed.

  
**Output **  
  
For each set, first print the number of the set, as shown in the sample
output. Then print the line ``The minimum number of moves is k.'', where k is
the minimum number of bricks that have to be moved in order to make all the
stacks the same height.

  
Output a blank line after each set.

  
**Sample Input **

**Sample Output **  
  
Set #1

The minimum number of moves is 5.
