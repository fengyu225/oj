Anna, Betty, Cindy and Zelda like playing the card game Euchre. Euchre is a
game for two teams of two, and each time they meet the girls split off into
different teams. They also keep overall records of the number of games each
player has won and lost. Anna has misplaced her won-loss results, but she does
have the results of the other three players. Given this, she figures she can
determine her won-loss record.

  
**Input**

Input will consist of multiple problem instances. Each instance will consist
of a single line containing six integers. The first two are the number of wins
and losses (respectively) for Betty, the next two are the number of wins and
losses for Cindy and the last two are the number of wins and losses for Zelda.
A final line of six zeroes will terminate input and should not be processed.

  
**Output**

For each problem instance, output a single line indicating Anna's won-loss
record, in the format shown in the example below.

  
**Sample Input**

10 3 6 7 8 5

1874 2945 2030 2789 1025 3794

0 0 0 0 0 0

  
**Sample Output**

Anna's won-loss record is 2-11.

Anna's won-loss record is 4709-110.
