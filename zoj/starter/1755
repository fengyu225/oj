Ms. Terry is a pre-school art teacher who likes to have her students work with
clay. One of her assignments is to form a lump of clay into a block and then
measure the dimensions of the block. However, in every class, there is always
one child who insists on taking some clay from some other child. Since Ms.
Terry always gives every child in a class the same amount of clay to begin
with, you can write a program that helps Ms. Terry find the bully and victim
after she measures each child's finished block.

  
**Input**

There are one or more classes of students, followed by a final line containing
only the value -1. Each class starts with a line containing an integer, n,
which is the number of students in the class, followed by n lines of student
information. Each line of student information consists of three positive
integers, representing the dimensions of the clay block, followed by the
student's first name. There can never be more than 9 students nor less than 2
students in any class. Each student's name is at most 8 characters. Ms. Terry
always gives each student at most 250 cubic units of clay. There is exactly
one bully and one victim in each class.

  
**Output **

For each class print a single line exactly as shown in the sample output.
