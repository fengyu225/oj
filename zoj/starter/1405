Tan Your Hide, Inc., owns several coin-operated tanning salons. Research has
shown that if a customer arrives and there are no beds available, the customer
will turn around and leave, thus costing the company a sale. Your task is to
write a program that tells the company how many customers left without
tanning.

The input consists of data for one or more salons, followed by a line
containing the number 0 that signals the end of the input. Data for each salon
is a single line containing a positive integer, representing the number of
tanning beds in the salon, followed by a space, followed by a sequence of
uppercase letters. Letters in the sequence occur in pairs. The first
occurrence indicates the arrival of a customer, the second indicates the
departure of that same customer. No letter will occur in more than one pair.
Customers who leave without tanning always depart before customers who are
currently tanning. There are at most 20 beds per salon.

For each salon, output a sentence telling how many customers, if any, walked
away. Use the exact format shown below.
