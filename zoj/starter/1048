Larry graduated this year and finally has a job. He's making a lot of money,
but somehow never seems to have enough. Larry has decided that he needs to
grab hold of his financial portfolio and solve his financing problems. The
first step is to figure out what's been going on with his money. Larry has his
bank account statements and wants to see how much money he has. Help Larry by
writing a program to take his closing balance from each of the past twelve
months and calculate his average account balance.

  
**Input Format:**   
  
The input will be twelve lines. Each line will contain the closing balance of
his bank account for a particular month. Each number will be positive and
displayed to the penny. No dollar sign will be included.

  
**Output Format: **  
  
The output will be a single number, the average (mean) of the closing balances
for the twelve months. It will be rounded to the nearest penny, preceded
immediately by a dollar sign, and followed by the end-of-line. There will be
no other spaces or characters in the output.

  
  

**Sample Input: **  
  
100.00

489.12

12454.12

1234.10

823.05
