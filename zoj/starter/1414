Starting from point (0,0) on a plane, we have written all non-negative
integers 0, 1, 2,... as shown in the figure. For example, 1, 2, and 3 has been
written at points (1,1), (2,0), and (3, 1) respectively and this pattern has
continued.

You are to write a program that reads the coordinates of a point (x, y), and
writes the number (if any) that has been written at that point. (x, y)
coordinates in the input are in the range 0...5000.

  
**Input**  
  
The first line of the input is N, the number of test cases for this problem.
In each of the N following lines, there is x, and y representing the
coordinates (x, y) of a point.

  
**Output**  
  
For each point in the input, write the number written at that point or write
No Number if there is none.

  
**Sample Input**
