Over the years, the people of the great city of Pittsburgh have repeatedly
demonstrated a collective expertise at football second to none. Recently a spy
has discovered the true source of the city's football power-a wizard known
only as "Myron," who is infallible at selecting the proper position at which
each player will excel.

Now that you know the source of Pittsburgh's wisdom, you are determined to
provide your school's football team with a computer program that matches the
wisdom of "Myron." You have consulted with the best football minds you can
find, and they have dispensed their wisdom on the slowest speed, minimum
weight, and minimum strength required to play each position.

Using this knowledge, you will develop a program that reads in several players
physical attributes and outputs what position(s) they are able to play.

  

**Input**

Each line of the input file will list the attributes for one player:

<speed> <weight> <strength>

Each number will be a real-valued number. The file will end with a line
reading "0 0 0".

  

**Output**

For each player, you will output one line listing the positions that player
can play. A player can play a position if each of their attributes is greater
or equal to the minimum for weight and strength, and less than or equal to the
slowest speed. If a player can play multiple positions, output them in the
order listed above, separated by whitespace. You can not leave an extra space
at the end of the line. If a player can play no positions, write "No
positions" on the line.

  

**Sample Input**

4.4 180 200

5.5 350 700

4.4 205 350

5.2 210 500
