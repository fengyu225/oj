Mathematics can be so easy when you have a computer. Consider the following
example. You probably know that in a right-angled triangle, the length of the
three sides a, b, c (where c is the longest side, called the hypotenuse)
satisfy the relation a*a+b*b=c*c. This is called Pythagora's Law.

Here we consider the problem of computing the length of the third side, if two
are given.

**Input**

The input contains the descriptions of several triangles. Each description
consists of a line containing three integers a, b and c, giving the lengths of
the respective sides of a right-angled triangle. Exactly one of the three
numbers is equal to -1 (the 'unknown' side), the others are positive (the
'given' sides).

A description having a=b=c=0 terminates the input.

  
**Output**

For each triangle description in the input, first output the number of the
triangle, as shown in the sample output. Then print "Impossible." if there is
no right-angled triangle, that has the 'given' side lengths. Otherwise output
the length of the 'unknown' side in the format "s = l", where s is the name of
the unknown side (a, b or c), and l is its length. l must be printed exact to
three digits to the right of the decimal point.

Print a blank line after each test case.

  
**Sample Input**

3 4 -1

-1 2 7  
5 -1 3

0 0 0

**  
Sample Output**

Triangle #1

c = 5.000

  
Triangle #2

a = 6.708

  
Triangle #3

Impossible.
