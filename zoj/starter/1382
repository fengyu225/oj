Given a positive integer n and the odd integer o and the nonnegative integer p
such that n = o2^p.

  
**Example**  
  
For n = 24, o = 3 and p = 3.

  
**Task**  
  
Write a program which for each data set:

reads a positive integer n,

  
computes the odd integer o and the nonnegative integer p such that n = o2^p,

  
writes the result.

  
**Input**  
  
The first line of the input contains exactly one positive integer d equal to
the number of data sets, 1 <= d <= 10. The data sets follow.

  
Each data set consists of exactly one line containing exactly one integer n, 1
<= n <= 10^6.

**  
Output**

  
The output should consists of exactly d lines, one line for each data set.

Line i, 1 <= i <= d, corresponds to the i-th input and should contain two
integers o and p separated by a single space such that n = o2^p.

  
**Sample Input**

**  
Sample Output**
