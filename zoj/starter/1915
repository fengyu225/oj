It is said that 90% of frosh expect to be above average in their class. You
are to provide a reality check.

  
**Input**

The first line of standard input contains an integer C, the number of test
cases. C data sets follow. Each data set begins with an integer, N, the number
of people in the class (1 <= N <= 1000). N integers follow, separated by
spaces or newlines, each giving the final grade (an integer between 0 and 100)
of a student in the class.

  
**Output**

For each case you are to output a line giving the percentage of students whose
grade is above average, rounded to 3 decimal places.
