**Input**  
  
One line for each testcase.

  
The integer N (1 <= N <= 10000) comes first and is followed by N integers
representing the states of the lights ("1" for on and "0" for off).

  
Process to the end-of-file.

  
**Output**  
  
For each testcase output a line consists of only the least times of switches.
