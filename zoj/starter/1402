Sam and Ella run a catering service. They like to put on a show when serving
meatballs to guests seated at round tables. They march out of the kitchen with
pots of meatballs and start serving adjacent guests. Ella goes
counterclockwise and Sam goes clockwise, until they both plop down their last
meatball, at the same time, again at adjacent guests. This impressive routine
can only be accomplished if they can divide the table into two sections, each
having the same number of meatballs. You are to write a program to assist
them.

At these catering events, each table seats 2 <= N <= 30 guests. Each guest
orders at least one and at most nine meatballs. Each place at the table is
numbered from 1 to N, with the host at position 1 and the host's spouse at
position N. Sam always serves the host first then proceeds to serve guests in
increasing order. Ella serves the spouse first, then serves guests in
decreasing order. The figures illustrate the first two example input cases.

Input consists of one or more test cases. Each test case contains the number
of guests N followed by meatballs ordered by each guest, from guest 1 to guest
N. The end of the input is a line with a single zero.

For each table, output a single line with the ending positions for Sam and
Ella, or the sentence indicating an equal partitioning isn't possible. Use the
exact formatting shown below.

  
**Sample Input**  
  
5 9 4 2 8 3

5 3 9 4 2 8

6 1 2 1 2 1 2

6 1 2 1 2 1 1

0

  
**Sample Output**  
  
Sam stops at position 2 and Ella stops at position 3.

No equal partitioning.

No equal partitioning.

Sam stops at position 3 and Ella stops at position 4.
