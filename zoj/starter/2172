In your job at Albatross Circus Management (yes, it's run by a bunch of
clowns), you have just finished writing a program whose output is a list of
names in nondescending order by length (so that each name is at least as long
as the one preceding it). However, your boss does not like the way the output
looks, and instead wants the output to appear more symmetric, with the shorter
strings at the top and bottom and the longer strings in the middle. His rule
is that each pair of names belongs on opposite ends of the list, and the first
name in the pair is always in the top part of the list. In the first example
set below, Bo and Pat are the first pair, Jean and Kevin the second pair, etc.

**Input**

The input consists of one or more sets of strings, followed by a final line
containing only the value 0. Each set starts with a line containing an
integer, _n_, which is the number of strings in the set, followed by _n_
strings, one per line, sorted in nondescending order by length. None of the
strings contain spaces. There is at least one and no more than 15 strings per
set.&nbsp_place_holder; Each string is at most 25 characters
long.&nbsp_place_holder;

**Output**

For each input set print "SET n" on a line, where n starts at 1, followed by
the output set as shown in the sample output.
